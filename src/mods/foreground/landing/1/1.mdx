## How are we funded?

<div className="h-2"/>

We, the community, only get money from people who believe in us, not from big investors. This way, we stay connected and work together towards common goals. We received 116 ETH in donations through Juicebox, a crowdfunding platform. This shows that many people believe in our project and wants to help it succeed.

## How are we governed?

<div className="h-2"/>

We, the community, run things through a DAO. We choose a council to make decisions like where to spend money, what features to add, and how to make the community bigger. We can vote anytime to change the council if we want. Everything is transparent and open to the public. And more importantly, nobody can shut us down.
