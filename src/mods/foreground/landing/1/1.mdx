## How are we governed?

<div className="h-2"/>

We are governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that is comprised of our community members. The DAO is responsible for electing a council that is responsible for making decisions on how to allocate funds, what features to build, and how to grow the community. The DAO can continuously and at any time vote to replace the council with a new one.
