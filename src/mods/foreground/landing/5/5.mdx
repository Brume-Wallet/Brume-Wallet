We ensure that we always have the true blockchain state by using an algorithm that creates a consensus out of multiple servers. This means that if one server is compromised and lying about the blockchain state, we can detect it by comparing its state with the state of other servers. This is similar to how the blockchain itself works, but with a reduced number of servers.

We use servers from different providers and different locations to prevent a single point of failure.
